  abstract = {This paper presents a new polychoric instrumental variable (PIV) estimator to use in structural equation models (SEMs) with categorical observed variables. The PIV estimator is a generalization of Bollen’s (Psychometrika 61:109–121, 1996) 2SLS/IV estimator for continuous variables to categorical endogenous variables. We derive the PIV estimator and its asymptotic standard errors for the regression coefficients in the latent variable and measurement models. We also provide an estimator of the variance and covariance parameters of the model, asymptotic standard errors for these, and test statistics of overall model fit. We examine this estimator via an empirical study and also via a small simulation study. Our results illustrate the greater robustness of the PIV estimator to structural misspecifications than the system-wide estimators that are commonly applied in SEMs.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Objectives:               A substantial body of research has documented age-related declines in cognitive abilities among adults over 60, yet there is much less known about changes in cognitive abilities during midlife. The goal was to examine longitudinal changes in multiple cognitive domains from early midlife through old age in a large national sample, the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study.               Methods:               The Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT) was administered on two occasions (MIDUS 2, MIDUS 3), an average of 9 years apart. At MIDUS 3, those with the cognitive assessment (               N               =2518) ranged in age from 42 to 92 years (               M               =64.30;               SD               =11.20) and had a mean education of 14.68 years (               SD               =2.63). The BTACT includes assessment of key aging-sensitive cognitive domains: immediate and delayed free recall, number series, category fluency, backward digit span, processing speed, and reaction time for attention switching and inhibitory control, which comprise two factors: episodic memory and executive functioning.               Results:               As predicted, all cognitive subtests and factors showed very small but significant declines over 9 years, with differences in the timing and extent of change. Processing speed showed the earliest and steepest decrements. Those with higher educational attainment scored better on all tests except reaction time. Men had better executive functioning and women performed better on episodic memory.               Conclusions:               Examining cognitive changes in midlife provides opportunities for early detection of cognitive impairments and possibilities for preventative interventions.

  abstract = {Longitudinal measurement invariance—the consistency of measurement in data collected over time—is a prerequisite for any meaningful inferences of growth patterns. When one or more items measuring the construct of interest show noninvariant measurement properties over time, it leads to biased parameter estimates and inferences on the growth parameters. In this paper, I extend the recently developed alignment-within-confirmatory factor analysis (AwC) technique to adjust for measurement biases for growth models. The proposed AwC method does not require a priori knowledge of noninvariant items and the iterative searching of noninvariant items in typical longitudinal measurement invariance research. Results of a Monte Carlo simulation study comparing AwC with the partial invariance modeling method show that AwC largely reduces biases in growth parameter estimates and gives good control of Type I error rates, especially when the sample size is at least 1,000. It also outperforms the partial invariance method in conditions when all items are noninvariant. However, all methods give biased growth parameter estimates when the proportion of noninvariant parameters is over 25\%. Based on the simulation results, I conclude that AO is a viable alternative to the partial invariance method in growth modeling when it is not clear whether longitudinal measurement invariance holds. The current paper also demonstrates AwC in an example modeling neuroticism over three time points using a public data set, which shows how researchers can compute effect size indices for noninvariance in AwC to assess to what degree invariance holds and whether AwC results are trustworthy.},

  abstract = {In path analysis, using composite scores without adjustment for measurement unreliability and violations of factorial invariance across groups lead to biased estimates of path coefficients. Although joint modeling of measurement and structural models can theoretically yield consistent structural association estimates, estimating a model with many variables is often impractical in small samples. A viable alternative is two-stage path analysis (2S-PA), where researchers first obtain factor scores and the corresponding individual-specific reliability coefficients, and then use those factor scores to analyze structural associations while accounting for their unreliability. The current paper extends 2S-PA to also account for partial invariance. Two simulation studies show that 2S-PA outperforms joint modeling in terms of model convergence, the efficiency of structural parameter estimation, and confidence interval coverage, especially in small samples and with categorical indicators. We illustrate 2S-PA by reanalyzing data from a multiethnic study that predicts drinking problems using college-related alcohol beliefs.},

However, commonly used frequentist and Bayesian estimation procedures do not honor this distinction. They allow the outcomes to influence the latent variables and the measurement model parameters for the indicators, rendering the latent variables subject to interpretational confounding. Modified Bayesian procedures that preclude this are advanced, along with procedures for conducting diagnostic model-data fit analyses. These are studied in a simulation, where they outperform existing strategies, and illustrated with an example.},
